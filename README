Some Python scripts to simulate a single-dish submm survey and
interferometric follow-up.

Note that these depend on a couple of binary FITS files in
subdirectory cls/ which have not been included in this repository
(these are maps that were produced as part of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology
Legacy Survey data reduction pipeline). Contact the authors directly
if you wish to obtain them.

To run simulations:

cd sim
./mapsim.py

To create plots
./plots.py

You can control the number of realizations of the simulation (currently 10)
by fiddling "nruns" in each of those Python scripts. There are also
various other constants you can change in mapsim, like:

sc2_noise: noise in mJy of final smoothed SCUBA-2 maps
sma_noise: noise in mJy of the SMA maps
  rsearch: search radius (arcsec) for counterpart identification
