To run simulations:

cd sim
./mapsim.py

To create plots
./plots.py

Note that these depend on a couple of FITS files in ../cls.

You can control the number of realizations of the simulation (currently 10)
by fiddling "nruns" in each of those Python scripts. There are also
various other constants you can change in mapsim, like:

sc2_noise: noise in mJy of final smoothed SCUBA-2 maps
sma_noise: noise in mJy of the SMA maps
  rsearch: search radius (arcsec) for counterpart identification
